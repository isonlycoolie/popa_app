## üîç Key Research Findings

### Competitive Analysis
- **RCS Fallback Issues**: Messages fail silently without automatic fallback
- **MMS Size Limitations**: Large attachments fail without user warning
- **APN Configuration**: No diagnostic information for MMS failures
- **Group Messaging**: Carrier-imposed limits cause silent failures
- **Delivery Status**: Inconsistent status indicators across apps
- **Network Dependency**: Apps become non-functional offline

### User Personas
1. **Sarah - Busy Professional**: Needs reliable messaging with clear status
2. **Marcus - Accessibility User**: Requires screen reader support and large touch targets
3. **Elena - Privacy-Conscious User**: Wants local data storage and no cloud dependency

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 48dp for all interactive elements
- **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 ratio for WCAG AA compliance
- **Font Scaling**: Support up to 200% zoom
- **Screen Reader**: Full semantic markup and navigation support

---

## üé® Design Decisions

### Design System
- **Typography**: 16sp body text with 1.5 line height
- **Spacing**: 8pt grid system with consistent spacing tokens
- **Touch Targets**: 48dp minimum with 56dp for primary actions
- **Color Palette**: Light and dark themes with high contrast
- **Bubble Design**: iOS-inspired with Material Design principles

### Wireframe Annotations
- **Font Sizes**: All text elements annotated with exact sizes
- **Touch Areas**: 48dp minimum touch targets clearly marked
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing tokens throughout
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance verified for all elements

### Theme Implementation
- **Light Theme**: White background with green outgoing bubbles
- **Dark Theme**: Black background with blue outgoing bubbles
- **Contrast**: 4.5:1 ratio maintained in both themes
- **Accessibility**: High contrast mode support
